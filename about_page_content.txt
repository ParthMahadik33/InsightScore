ABOUT INSIGHTSCORE
================================================================================

Welcome to InsightScore - Your trusted partner in understanding creditworthiness through innovative AI-powered financial analysis.

InsightScore is a revolutionary FinTech platform that combines traditional credit bureau scores (CIBIL) with advanced behavioral analysis to provide you with a comprehensive, accurate, and fair credit assessment. We believe that your creditworthiness should reflect not just your past credit history, but also your current financial behavior and discipline.

================================================================================
OUR MISSION
================================================================================

To democratize credit assessment by providing transparent, fair, and comprehensive credit scoring that goes beyond traditional metrics. We aim to help individuals understand their financial health better and enable lenders to make more informed decisions.

================================================================================
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
================================================================================

1. HYBRID SCORING APPROACH
   Traditional credit scores only look at your credit history. InsightScore combines:
   - CIBIL Score (40%): Your traditional credit bureau score
   - Behavioral Score (60%): AI-analyzed financial behavior patterns
   
   This gives a more complete picture of your creditworthiness.

2. AI-POWERED ANALYSIS
   We use Google's Gemini AI to analyze your financial behavior across six key dimensions:
   - Income Stability: How consistent and reliable your income is
   - Spending Discipline: Your ability to control expenses
   - Savings Behavior: Your savings patterns and financial cushion
   - Payment Discipline: Your track record of paying bills on time
   - Digital Behavior: Your adoption of digital payment methods
   - Lifestyle Stability: Your financial stability and predictability

3. DOCUMENT-BASED VERIFICATION
   For the most accurate score, upload your official documents:
   - CIBIL Credit Report
   - Bank Statements
   - UPI Transaction History
   - Salary Slips
   
   Our system extracts key metrics and provides verified behavioral analysis.

4. PRIVACY FIRST
   - All documents are processed locally
